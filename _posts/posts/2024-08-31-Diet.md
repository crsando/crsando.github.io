这个月被咳嗽困扰，一开始以为是感冒，扛了一段时间是好是坏，喉咙痒，昨天感觉这样不行去了躺医院做了检查。

做喉镜真的感觉自己快难受死了。

最后医生表示主要是感冒没好清楚，炎症反应引发的增生，诊断慢性咽喉炎，给我开了复方甲氧那明胶囊。

其实一直觉得自己的炎症反应比较频繁了，亚健康严重，这样是不行的。投资交易压力是一方面，之前工作强度大精神压力大是一方面，
睡眠不好也是一个问题。

还有就是饮食上，需要再注意一点。

### Anti-Inflammatory Foods to Add to Your Diet
If you are seeking to minimize your risk of developing dementia, adding anti-inflammatory foods to your diet may help combat systemic inflammation. Examples include:

1. Berries
> Berries, including blackberries, blueberries, raspberries, and strawberries, contain a high amount of antioxidants known as polyphenols that can help fight inflammation.
2. Nuts
> Nuts are rich sources of antioxidants with anti-inflammatory potential. A review published in Nutrients in 2023 found that tree nuts and peanuts can help lower risk factors for cardiometabolic diseases.
3. Fatty Fish
> Fish such as salmon, sardines, anchovies, and mackerel are good sources of anti-inflammatory omega-3 fatty acids.
4. Avocado
> Certain compounds in avocados are linked to anti-inflammatory properties.
5. Green Tea and matcha
> EGCG, a component of green tea, is known to regulate inflammation.
6. Olive Oil
> A study published in the International Journal of Molecular Sciences in 2018 found that oleocanthal, a compound present in extra virgin olive oil, has similar effects as the nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug ibuprofen when ingested in the same amounts.
7. Vegetables
> Leafy greens are high in the antioxidant beta-carotene, which reduces inflammation. Peppers, such as bell and chili, contain vitamin C and quercetin, both of which have been shown to lower inflammation. Sulforaphane, an antioxidant found in cruciferous vegetables such as broccoli, cauliflower, and Brussels sprouts, is shown to prevent inflammation.
8. Turmeric
> Turmeric is rich in curcumin, which has been shown to contain anti-inflammatory properties.
9. Mushrooms
> Mushrooms are rich in antioxidants. Though more research is warranted, an animal study published in Antioxidants in 2019 found that lion’s mane may offer neuroprotective and anti-inflammatory qualities.

### Inflammatory Foods to Avoid
While adding anti-inflammatory foods to your diet may help assuage systemic inflammation, removing common inflammatory culprits is another practical approach:

1. **Excess sugar** and high-fructose corn syrup intake is linked to an inflammatory response.
2. A diet high in **refined carbohydrates**, such as processed foods like **bread, pasta, and cereals**, is linked to neuroinflammatory processes in the brain.
3. **Fried foods** may contain high amounts of harmful compounds (advanced glycation end products) known to contribute to inflammation. Frying food also increases trans fats, which can promote inflammation.
4. Research ties heavy **alcohol** intake to systemic inflammation.
