# 1

Thank you all for coming here, and there's no place like Florida in the winter. I heard this afternoon that there had two feet of snow up north, and so I hope some of you were able to escape down here.

What I'd like to talk about this evening is start off with a presentation on a quick 10-minute snippet on technical analysis. When traders come to conferences like this, and even if they don't, traders throughout the ages are always searching, looking at different systems, different ideas, new innovations that come along, and investigating the work of the forefathers of technical analysis. Always seeking not only new ideas, but just subtle little ways to constantly refine your own program or plan that you follow. And sometimes just one little tool or one little idea keeps it fresh and keeps you going and feeling inspired and motivated.

So what I'd like to do is start off looking at what the basic principles of technical analysis are, and also four of the founding forefathers and the key concepts that they contributed. And this is important for a couple reasons. These guys sat there and did their work and their analysis in the early 1900s. You had a lot of volatility and interesting times going on, and you didn't have the advent of computers and research. So a lot of their observations are on changeless patterns that hold up in the markets today, and those tend to be the most durable and robust and most basic.

And I have to say that when I started trading on the trading floor, it was like 19 years ago, and I feel like I myself have really only gotten into this area in the past seven years and can really start to appreciate it how important it can be in your trading, and how it can simplify the structure of the markets for you. So I want to introduce just a little bit of the history and foundation of technical analysis that we have now, and then I want to spend some time talking about something that's very overlooked with some of these key forefathers.

They were all great authors, great journalists, and great writers, and even though about half of their writing pertained to technical setups in the market, if you read between the lines and take the time to really study their work, I would say a good portion of what they wrote about also pertained to the psychological or the mental aspects of trading. And of course, people that are active in the market know that probably having the entry set up and the game plan is 10% of the game, and your ability to execute, to stay prepared on top of it mentally is probably about 90% of it.

And that comes down to simple things such as if you have a losing trade or you have a good trade, you know, or there's an aberration in the market's behavior, I would say that your success will be entirely dependent on your ability to move on to the next trade, to leave the trade that you've just closed out or just finished and move on to the next one and always be forward looking. And this is a point that was brought up by these men too. So we'll touch on that, and then I want to tie the talk all together at the end. Better take off my watch right now so I don't end up speaking for three hours here.

I want to tie the talk all together at the end with a simple little program in scalping S&Ps or day trading S&Ps. My program, some of the applications that I follow that just tie in three or four of these very basic principles, and you'll see how it will all start to fall together. It can be a little bit overwhelming with the software applications that we have when you start looking at all the fancy lines and stuff, and you've got to really understand the reasons why the market does what it does or understand the concepts behind a certain pattern in addition to just looking at the actual pattern.

***So I want to start off by just saying that technical analysis is based on three principles that you have to accept.*** 

And the first one is that ***the market is a discounting mechanism***. You have to believe if you are going to be a student of technical analysis that every known piece of information out there is already priced into the market in some way, shape, or form, because there are always interests with a lot more money than us, with much deeper pockets than us, with large commercial concerns that can afford to do the research, the study, be right on top of the latest statistics, the movement, et cetera, and they know this information.

You have to assume, number one, that all this is priced into the market. It's a discounting mechanism.

Number two, you have to believe and you have to have faith that ***technical analysis is the study of mass psychology***. It's **crowd behavior** and that **patterns will repeat themselves**. And if you believe that there's constantly going to be a repetition of patterns because crowds behave the same way, not individuals, crowds do, then that too will give you that optimism that there can be discovered patterns in the market that will repeat themselves over and over and this is how we can capitalize on them, make our profits on them.

And the third thing that is important to understand is that ***markets either are consolidating or trending.*** A very simple concept. Once that our market is trending, the odds are that it will continue to trend. So these are the three basic premises on which this whole science is built and it's really actually more of an art than a science.

Now of course the forefather of technical analysis, we all know of as Charles Dow. And Dow was an author, a journalist. He first started in 1880s writing down his observations and he wrote a series of editorials and articles around 1901 through 1903 that comprise the foundation of his work. And it's really three other men that we can attribute to formalizing his work into a body of theories or principles. And these three men are Hamilton, Rhea, and Nelson. And each of them wrote books in their turn. So if you're a serious student of technical analysis, Samuel Nelson wrote a wonderful book called "The ABCs of Stock Speculation." Rhea wrote and Hamilton wrote. And these would be important works to study.

I have to repeat again, all these men are noting not only their technical observations on the markets, but they were all active traders too. Charles Dow was a trader, Schaubacher, Wyckoff, Elliott, they all traded in the market. And so they do incorporate into their work, again the constant mental aspects, if you read between the lines.

So Dow started putting down his work in the session of editorials, which later was comprised into a more substantial body and named ***"Dow Theory."*** The basic principles that Dow contributed still pertain today in numerous ways. The basic things that he noted was that ***there's always going to be three different movements in the market, the primary trend, the secondary trend, and the minor trend.*** And that's nothing more than saying, okay, you've got daily fluctuations, weekly fluctuations, and long four-year cycles.

To this day, ***all the successful traders that I know tend to incorporate more than one time frame in their analysis.*** It's important to look at the hourlies in conjunction with the dailies or the daily charts in conjunction with the weeklies to get more of a three-dimensional picture of the overall structure of the market. It will make a difference in your trading in the long run, the more time frames you incorporate in doing your analysis. So Dow put that forth right in the beginning.

The second thesis that he put forth is that ***the market will always move in action-reaction.*** Okay, well that sounds like a pretty basic type of concept, you know. You're always hoping for that reaction when you're on the wrong side of it, right? And that's when you don't get that reaction. But as a general rule of thumb, the market's going to alternate back and forth in these types of waves or sequences.

The next thing that he said is that ***the markets do tend to trend.*** And here's an interesting comment I have to share with you. I had been trading on the floor for a number of years and had been a trader for about 10 years. And I was a member of the Market Technicians Association. And finally, through the prompting of another buddy of mine, he's like, "Hey, let's go up and get our CMT test, which is this certification that you actually know what the technical analysis is." I'm like, "I've been a trader for a number of years. I know that kind of stuff."

Well, you start reading and you start to realize how little you know. And one of the questions they asked was, "What is the definition of a trend in terms of classical technical analysis?" And if somebody had asked me, it's like, "Well, the market's going up. How do you define that the market is going up? Are you going to measure it by moving averages? Are you going to measure it by if it's broken through a channel?" And Dow was the one who classically defined his trend as having a higher high and a higher low. You have to have both of those to define an uptrend and a lower low and a lower high defines a downtrend.

Once you have defined that sequence, then you can go on to extrapolate the odds favored or the probabilities lie that that trend will continue. Maybe not 90% of the time, but then that would be where the odds would lie. And ultimately, in this game, that's all we're doing is quantifying probabilities. 

So Dow contributed  the last two important things that he set forth were volume works in conjunction with price, and most people are very aware of the fact that volume tends to increase in the direction of the trend and dry up on the reactions.

And then the last thing that he put forth was that the market will, at times in its corrective process, make a line, a sideways line. And he defined what the line was. And that too sets forth a basis for a trade plan at a later point. We can look at lines all the time in the market. Sideways lines, congestion areas, consolidation areas. And again, this was part of the foundation that people then went on to, with point and figure charting, to quantify the lines and where they projected.

The next person that came along after Dow, and all these men actually were in the markets at the same time. They were all trading at the same time. They were all writing at the same time. Most of them died young, for all your conclusions there, about the business. But the next person was a person named Schaubacher.

And Schaubacher wrote three stupendous volumes of books. And of course, he died in his early 30s, and it's a real shame, because I think he was a very prolific writer, and one of his books was just republished. But Schaubacher actually is the father of the pure science of technical analysis. And by that, I mean the objective ability to classify chart patterns.

He was the one who gave the names to head and shoulders, and triangles, and flags, and he had about 10 different names for different types of triangles. And he also documented gap theory. For example, if the market gaps up, and it doesn't fill that gap, that in and of itself has powerful forecasting information.

He was the one that used trend lines to define support and resistance levels. And these very basic concepts, I mean you can make it as a trader if you have a solid understanding of just the simple support and resistance. Looking at the swing lows, looking at the swing highs, and seeing how the market trades around those points.

So these were some of the things that Schaubacher contributed. In his classification of patterns, I will tell you the two most important pieces of information that I got out of studying this. And again, it's just from a conceptual standpoint, and it might sound overly simple, but I'm gonna show you how it ties in at the end when you're actually trading.

The simplest thing that he said was, with chart patterns, he separated them into reversal patterns or continuation patterns. And obviously continuation patterns would be small flags, pennants, triangles. Reversal patterns would be head and shoulders, broadening tops. And as a general rule of thumb, continuation patterns are much shorter than reversal patterns.

And the longer a market starts to trade sideways, ultimately, the greater the odds that it will be a reversal pattern. So if you're a trader and you see a large thrust up, and the market starts to pull back and consolidate, and it looks like it's a bull flag, in other words, forecasting another leg up. But instead, it keeps going sideways and sideways and sideways.

Odds are, then, that that bull flag will fail and it'll come out the downside. And actually, that same pattern happened yesterday in the S&Ps, when we rallied up sharply in the morning, and we proceeded to go sideways, sideways, and instead of having another leg up, it had to have a very sharp washout first before it then came back in the afternoon.

So if you're a trader, you can be on your guard if the market starts to go sideways for too long, be on the guard for a potential reversal. So those were two of the things that I got out of Schaubacher's teachings.

The next person who took this one step further was Wyckoff. And Wyckoff put forth that instead of just having chart patterns, whose accumulation, markup distribution, now we actually have a sequence to the market's behavior. And Wyckoff was the one who gave the words or the definitions to things like a selling climax.

And if the market has climatic action, then you'll get an automatic reaction, or a rally back up, where all the people who got caught in it first want to get out, and the market has to go back down for a retest. So we introduced these concepts of the testing, the action-reaction, but again, put them into a sequence.

And the next thing that Wyckoff did was to look at the nuances within the chart patterns. Schaubacher was a little bit more mechanical in saying, okay, here's a bull flag, here's a sideways rectangular pattern. But now Wyckoff started going, how can we analyze which way this pattern might come out?

Let's look at the market's method for shaking out the longs first, before it comes out the upside, right? Let's look at the volume at those points, so we can see if that shakeout is for real or not. Let's look at the volume in the market two trading days ago on the S&Ps, when we traded down below the 1220 level again, down to 1218, and let's look at the volume that was occurring down there.

There wasn't any volume. We were making new lows, testing, trying to shake people out, trying to think that we were gonna break to the downside with no volume, and the market popped right back in, okay? Let's classify those types of patterns as springs and upthrusts and give them little names, hooks, so that we can start to have some forecasting value out of those small patterns.

So Wyckoff started to get a little bit more in depth in looking at these things. And lastly, he wasn't quite with this group because he came a little bit later, but Elliott, everybody knows of Elliott wave theory, which it was never originally called Elliott wave theory, but Elliott introduced the concept that waves can be patterns, all right?

Instead of just chart formations being patterns, that these waves repeat themselves, and he identified, okay, if you have a wave three or a large wave up, it's gonna pull back and go up for the retest. So it dovetails hand in glove with Wyckoff's sequence of looking at these climaxes, the rallies, the retests, and the most important principle that Elliott introduced to me was the concept of impulse, and I use that a lot now.

Impulse happens in the direction of the trend. I mean, once again, all these concepts sound so simple, but you'll find in your own analysis, in your own trading, that if you can start to think about the markets conceptually, what is it doing?

Conceptually, the beans, soybeans had a washout to the downside, of course, right into that first notice day, and they start to pop back up, but they still have to go down for that retest. It will help your trading, and if you're looking at that in terms of the daily picture, you're not going to get too caught up in looking at the five-minute charts or the 30-minute charts without understanding the overall structure.

The market has a play, it has a mission, and ultimately, the best traders I see are able to say, what is that market's play today? Should that market go up and test its highs? Should that market have one more shakeout to the downside?

Should the market go sideways to drive everybody nuts up here because the implied premium levels have been way too high? And we can see that in indicators like the VIX index, which has showed a very high implied volatility level, okay?

People are either buying puts looking for the downside or buying calls looking for new highs, but we've been in a big old trading range. And so ultimately, the market's going to go sideways to drive the most amount of people crazy until that premium level comes down.

So you have to think, what is the big play right now? What is the market's mission? And I always find it really interesting when we are in a trading range like we've been, I think that the sentiment tends to swing much more at the levels, at the support levels and the resistance levels. There's an element of tension.

As we approach new highs or new lows and people become very quick to flip in their sentiment. So that's one last addendum that will help you with your technical analysis into understanding all this.

We have the basics of looking at the chart patterns, looking at where the price has been, where are we in the overall structure, is there a trend? Where is support and where are resistance levels? And how does this fit in conjunction with the big weekly picture and if you look at your weekly charts on the market, you could see that the oscillators had actually all pulled back down.

You could make a case for like it being a fourth wave type of correction on the weeklies. And then how did the sentiment indicators govern where the price trades within that trading range? And it'll all start to make sense.

Now, these are just some basic principles of technical analysis. They do not ensure your success as a trader by any means. The main point I wanted to make is that all the information is given to us right there in the price, okay? The better that you get at being able to look and analyze raw price data, be it bar charts or watching the tape, the faster you will be as a trader.

I would say that 90% of the indicators that we tend to use in our canned programs, and I use them too, are price sensitive indicators. And therefore, they'll always be one step behind the price, be it a volatility indicator such as a standard deviation or an ADX or an oscillator, a momentum oscillator, they'll all turn one day behind the actual price or one bar behind the price.

So be aware of where you are in the overall structure, what the setup condition is. That's what technicals do for us. They tell us what the initial setup is, and then you have to have something that triggers you into that trade, all right?

You either need to say, okay, I'm going to buy it if it breaks the trend line, a buy stop, I'll use a volatility breakout system, I'll enter on a higher close, I'll enter on a test of the low, but once you have your initial setup, then you're looking for your condition that's going to trigger you into that trade.

And then the third component of the trade, of course, is the trade management. Now, all four of these authors emphasized in their writing the use of stops, and not for the reasons that you might necessarily think.

They're very clever in understanding human nature. Of course, we use stops for money management to protect ourselves, to build our confidence, to have the confidence to take a trade in the first place, because some of these setups could, you know, put you on the edge of your seat just a little bit.

But if we say, okay, I'm going to buy the S&P, and I'll risk three points, so I know that's the most that I can lose, it makes it a little bit more palatable to go in and take the trade. But here's another reason for understanding why trade management can be so important.

If you enter a trade and you manage it properly, that means putting an initial stop, moving that stop up to break even, or perhaps, as Wyckoff suggested, even a little bit higher to cover your costs of commissions.

And by properly managing a trade, by moving the stop up, what that does is that keeps you from taking profits too soon for fear of a reversal, okay? And that is a very critical concept, because I would say that when a good trade comes along, the biggest mistake people will make will be taking profits too soon, okay?

I'm all for selling into strength and buying into weakness, but one out of 10 times, you might just catch a good one. And if your weeklies and your dailies set it up, and if you can understand how to manage that trade, it will keep you in it a little bit longer than you might otherwise be.

So the trade management really is helping manage the heads, the psychology side. Now, all four of these men wrote in the early 1900s, and what I wanna do is I want to read off, I wanna read off about five basic principles that deal with the mental side of trading that all four of them wrote about, or mentioned at some point in their writings.

First of all, I want you to understand that these men devoted themselves to the market. They studied charts, they pored over past history, they wrote incessantly, they all had advisory services, they all traded, of course, half of them were bedridden from severe illnesses, so they couldn't do anything else but study the charts.

And what I'm trying to say is their life was the markets. So all four of them were very serious, dedicated students, looking constantly at charts and behavior, and they were able to boil it down to these very simple concepts that I just mentioned to you, the action-reaction definition of a trend.

And you have to understand that these were not concepts that had been introduced before at this time. So it really helped actually put enough sense into the market that it encouraged the individual speculator to come into the markets at this time, and they had never done that before.

It actually encouraged the individual speculator to start trading stocks, and so this was a new phenomena. So they all devoted it, they all did intensive work by hand, charting by hand, writing by hand, keeping notebooks by hand.

And I have to tell you for myself, I would say that this has been the biggest key to where I see people making it or breaking it. The people that take the time to either keep a notebook, write numbers down at the end of the day, keep bar charts by hand, are the people that I see that are consistently staying in the business.

And I have to share a story with you. I was in Chicago a couple of years ago at one of the firms I do business with, Sakura Delsher, and I had the opportunity to meet Leo Mahalmad, who used to be head of one of the exchanges there, and has been in the markets for a long time.

And of course, me and a friend go into his office, which had to have like half a million dollars worth of artwork, cherry wood panels, this beautiful desk, you know, the type that you can push a button and the little electronic screens come up out of a thin two-inch slit, you know? Everything there, right there at his fingertips.

And you know what he had on his desk? No clutter or anything, but his charts with pencil on graph paper and a little ruler. And he's like, come here, come here, come here. What do you think, is this a head and shoulders, is this a head and shoulders, you know?

He's always biased to the downside there on the short side. I'm like, oh, I don't know about that, you know? I just try and figure out the next five minutes there so I could keep myself out of trouble on that one, you know?

But my friend was so excited, he's tugging at my sleeve. He's like, look at that, look at that. Leo's charting by hand, you know? He's doing the hourly charts. And you know, Marty Schwartz, who is another trader in Florida that lives about three and a half hours south of us, keeps hourly bar charts by hand, graphing them by hand.

I've seen people graph the ticks or the premium levels by hand. This is very integral to getting your feel and building up your confidence level in the market. So all of these men did a tremendous amount of work with just pencil and paper, and that's something that I think gets overlooked a little bit today.

Now, all four of them would be the first to tell you, and they actually put this in their writings over and over again if you read between the lines, that even though they have their theories or their structures of market behavior, that actual practice and theory are two entirely different things, okay?

So even though Wyckoff had this model for a sequence of the way that price behavior unfolds, he'll tell you that the darn stuff works differently every single time. And you know what Elliot wrote in his book? He wrote that, well, he didn't actually write his book. Somebody else wrote his book, but in his writings, he wrote it took him three years to figure out how to put his own theory into practice.

And this is the guy that originated Elliot Wave Analysis. It took him three years to figure out how to use it. Like, how long is it supposed to take us to figure out how to use it, you know? So the actual practice and the theory are two different things, but we still have to have a structure or a model in our head.

The next thing they will tell you is that the frailty of human nature ultimately is going to always be the thing that we're battling against in our trading, our own emotions. And they all said that there's a certain temperament out there that you either have to develop or you're born with or whatever, but a certain temperament that will favor success more than another type of temperament.

And so you always have to be on guard to check your own emotions. Your best insurance against yourself is to have a trading plan before you start the trading day.

That is your best safety net. If you don't have some type of plan or written program or whatever type of thing you want to prepare when the markets are closed, okay, you're asking for trouble. Even if you're a day trader trading one minute scalps.

I'll tell you why that's important. I find that even if I'm sitting there and scalping off of a one minute system, and we have a fun little scalp that we do in our office that we call the short skirt trade now, okay, it's off of one minute charts. But I can tell you, I can tell you the odds of that strategy working before that day opens.

And I will tell you that if we've just had a very large move in the market, like a 30 point or a 40 point wide range day, a huge breakout, a range expansion day, and the next day is gonna be a consolidation type of day because if the market of course alternates back and forth between the movement and then the consolidation, I can tell you the odds of that strategy will drop off 50% of its success rate working.

All right, so that does impact me, even if I'm scalping off of a one minute chart, knowing the overall daily structure and conditions. Of course, I mentioned the ability to move on to the next trade, your ability to put the past behind you.

And that's why, again, with stop orders, you just never want to take that one big loss. It's not the damage to your account, it's the damage to your head. Because once you do that to yourself, you know, you're frazzled, you're fried, you're shaken up, and you don't resume trading as you should. And that's what keeps you then from making your living.

So all three of these men had three, or four of them had three cardinal rules. First of all, don't overtrade. Now, over trading does not mean the number of trades that you make, it doesn't mean that you're going in and out of the market 10 times a day. That's fine if you want to do that. It's the leverage that you use when you do that.

I've been a professional trader for 19 years. 99% of the people that I see blow out of this business, and I've seen a lot be it from the floor traders to CTAs to other traders, it's been a leverage function. Okay? It's trading 10 S&Ps on a $50,000 account, okay? Or it's selling out of the money puts. You know, if you're a big, big fund, selling out of the money puts way too big, and there's not the liquidity there when you need to get them back, and they explode in your face in the advent of a big move.

It's always the leverage that gets people. And you will see that in your own trading. If you look at your biggest losses, perhaps just ask yourself if they were your biggest positions in terms of number of contracts you have on. Because now you've got a vested interest in that position. All right? So that's something to think about.

One thing that I do in my own trading is I have a strict unit size. I do X amount of contracts on every trade, period. And I keep X amount of contracts, and it doesn't matter if it's corn or bonds, all right? It makes it simple for me. It's X number of contracts. That's my unit size. I don't vary it. That keeps me out of trouble.

So the leverage is what will ultimately take you out of the game. It's not not putting in a stop on a one lot and letting it run 10 points against you. That's not gonna blow you out of the water. The second thing, don't average a loss, okay? I averaged a loss for 10 years and I got away with it. But it's a very bad habit. And I probably would have been a lot more profitable if I hadn't done that, you know?

So all of us have done it at some times. I would say that's the biggest thing that I'm proud of in my own trading. And in the last six years, I put on my bet. I leave it alone. It works or it doesn't. You know, if it does start to work, you can always scalp in the direction of the trend alongside your base position, but do not average a loss. All right, that's the second thing. These are the people in the 1900s that were writing this.

And then the third thing, as I'm talking away, don't listen to others, all right? So, you know, if you sit there and you call up your best friend on the phone, or you talk to your broker, or you listen to CNBC, okay? Yeah, yeah, I see nodding heads, yes. It is so much harder for you to have confidence in your own analysis, number one, all right? And it's very hard for you to know when your trade isn't working. You'll get in the habit of starting to look for reasons or other factors out there to substantiate your position.

You've got to learn to become an independent trader. Now, that certainly doesn't mean that you can't go take somebody's course or follow somebody's newsletter or something like that to learn from an educational point of view, the setups and stuff. I mean, I'll be the first to tell you, you know, I've got something on the table there. We do this thing now, it's like on the internet and I post all the stuff that I'm doing, all right? The setups that I'm looking and the trades that I'm taking.

And I'll be the first to tell you that your ultimate goal should be, hey, watch it for a month, but your ultimate goal is to see the darn stuff for yourself, all right? And take the trades for yourself. And don't wait for somebody else to pull the trigger, you know? So you've got to learn to be an independent trader and take everything you synthesize here this weekend, or if you already have your own program, one little refinement to it and have your own program.

Make it your own, make it your own special business, your own game board that you play the game on, your own rules, and be happy about that. That is where, ultimately, you get the most reward out of the business. It is most satisfying if you have done the work or found the setup, take the trade and it works out, or manage it and it didn't work out, but you felt good because you saw it wasn't gonna work out and you had your stop in place.

And then, no matter what happens at the end of every day, whether you made money or you lost money, you can pat yourself on the back. That's the object of the game. It's a very similar principle to if your system's trading. If your system's trading, your object isn't whether you made or lost money that day, it's whether you followed the system or you followed the rules. And if you can say, I did everything I was supposed to do, it just wasn't my day to day, you can walk out of there feeling good that you did your job that day, and the same thing should be there on a discretionary level.

Now, here's another interesting thing. Even though all these men were documenting these chart patterns, these wave price behavior sequences, all of them emphasize the importance that watching the tape played in their own trading. And I will say this, 95% of the big traders that I know do sit there and watch the price action. That's what watching the tape is. It's not sitting there and watching a billion little ticker symbols go by at the bottom of CNBC.

It's monitoring the price action, perhaps for something unusual, perhaps for an unusual spike in the market's movement or unusual volume coming into the market. Or when you see the price go blip, blip, blip, blip, blip, blip, you know, all the way up like that. That catches your eye. There's nothing wrong with that because that is the purest way to watch impulse. Impulse indicates the direction of the trend. Impulse is usually followed by more impulse.

Okay, the odds are if you get a thrust in one direction, you will get a thrust in the next direction. Odds, high odds, not spikes, but high odds that you will get that impulse. So the eye is gonna be the first to catch that impulse. And the reason I say that is because that's important, especially for scalpers and the S&Ps or discretionary traders, for learning how to duck out of a position that it may not be going against you in terms of taking a loss, but let's say you have a nice profit in it and you're trying to push the profit.

Okay, this is usual, but I'll do it. As long as it keeps on making impulse in one direction, followed by little continuation patterns or small pauses, you try and stay with the trade and you'll usually get ideally, of course, in our ideal world, three pushes up or three impulse waves up. But if you're in something and it's making consolidation and it has a first down break against your position, even if you still have profits in the position, look to get out on that first pause. And you can keep it very, very simple like that.

So that's what I want to do now is go back down to a very basic model for S&P scalping, which we use in the markets, that I can show you, I can tell you in five minutes. And you can see it for yourself. It just takes a little practice, a little confidence. But I want you to understand conceptually what is going on.

First of all, let me preface it by saying that with the S&Ps, I actually started trading them the very first day that they were listed. And I traded them when I was a floor trader on the floor in the equity options. We'd trade them on the side. I traded them as a CTA. When I first started trading this market, I was very much a counter trend trader. And in those days, there wasn't much of a trend.

We didn't have to worry about the big bull market of '95 and '96 and '97, you know, clocking you out of the water. So I used to use the ticks a lot and wait until the ticks were overbought or oversold, go in with a counter trend position, and trade it in that manner. And I used to chart the hourly cycles and look at the premium and some various other factors.

And back to my study of technical analysis and all the things I have looked at in 19 years, and, you know, there's a lot of people that have been in the market much longer than I am, and they'll probably agree with what I'm going to say. I will tell you the easiest, cleanest, quickest pattern to trade. And that is a simple, small little bull flag or bear flag.

That is the simplest pattern that you can identify in the market where you can go in and make the most amount of money in the least amount of time. It is a continuation pattern. In other words, we've already let the market break out and tell us the direction that is running. You know, we're not geniuses here in picking bottoms or reversals or anything like that. We're looking for that first thrust up that tells us that there's somebody very anxious to get into this market.

You'll get a small pullback, a small bull flag, and you will get a second leg up. Now, you will see the small bull flag, bear flag, sometimes it's a little triangle, sometimes it's a pause. You will see that on one-minute charts, five-minute charts, daily charts, weekly charts. You will see it on every single timeframe.

And if you can train yourself to be sensitive to that one little pattern, you don't need oscillators to look at it. You don't need to even look at the volume in the situation. You just want to make sure that the market is active, that there is volume, because one more thing that all these men, these forefathers of technical analysis said, don't trade in dull, quiet markets. Don't trade when there is no volume.

It was very, very choppy a week or two ago in the S&Ps. The bid-ask spread was wide. There wasn't a whole lot of volume. And it was, you know, you're just going to get chewed up back and forth on adverse slippage and bad execution. So wait until the market comes to life. And you can see in the last -- well, forget today. You know, the day was -- I don't even know where we closed, but it wasn't choice trading this morning.

But the day before and the day before that, you can start to see, once we get running, the small bull flags and bear flags that start to set up, the continuation patterns, all right? So think about that. Continuation pattern allows you a couple things. It allows you to limit your risk. You're going in the direction of the trend. The market's already moving.

The only thing that it requires is for you to be on top of the market, okay? They don't sit there and ring a bell and say, "Okay, we're going to hold it down here in this window for the next 20 minutes while you call your broker and futz around with the price." And usually when I do my trading, I enter everything at the market, everything. Buy, you know, buy at the market and I exit at the market.

When it's moving, you can't afford to miss that one good trade. And if I miss a little five-point move in the S&Ps, think about all the bad execution that would pay for it, you know, and all the slippage. That's not bad on part of the brokers. It's just like times when the pit's, you know, thin and you want it badly enough, you pay up for it.

And so that's sort of one thing that I subscribe to a little bit now. So this concept of entering on these small continuation patterns, what do we have here? We've got a basic chart pattern, all right, small. It's a small chart pattern. It's not a big thing that we have to analyze and say, "Gee, is this a big top here in the S&P for the last two, three months? Is it going to come out the upside or the downside?"

You know, "Well, why don't I just go hit my head against the cinder block wall for ten times and see if that feels good?" You know, you don't know, you can't know. It's going to get in your way of making money today. And that's the concept I want to get down to, making money right now. The small continuation patterns will best serve you.

Now, let's increase the odds that these continuation patterns are going to work. All you have to do is look at one higher time frame. That's it, one higher time frame, and let me explain why. If you are just working on a one-dimensional playing field, and let's say all you are doing is looking at a five-minute S&P chart, and I keep on using the S&Ps because most people have looked at that market or desire to trade it at some point.

If you're just looking at a five-minute time frame, you don't understand, you don't see enough data of what's happened before. And let's say theoretically that you've just had a huge run-up, a huge mark-up on the hourly charts. Let's say you've had a run-up like we had in the last two, three days where we've gone up a number of handles.

Well, what's going to happen is that short-term time frame, you might get a little correction down or just a little blip, but there's so much support underneath. The momentum has been so strong. The impulse on the higher time frames is so strong that you might just be getting a little retest. In other words, you might be playing for a very small amount with not a lot of potential.

In other words, I'm not saying that go and say that the daily trend is up, therefore I'm only going to buy hourly pullbacks, because that concept has its flaws too. But what I'm saying is just make sure that if you're buying on that hourly time frame, it's not right after you've had a huge downfall for two days and the market has to go back to that Wyckoff sequence of test, reaction, test, reaction, and there's not going to be a whole lot of play.

You see? You see? It's like if that sugar market or cocoa or pick any market that's been falling out of bed and you see that huge price drop over a two- to three-day period, what's got to happen? The market's got to chop around and back and fill and back and fill, and you don't want to get sucked into playing the upside on a short-term time frame too soon. So that's all. It's just a filter. Use a higher time frame as a filter.

So we've got our small continuation patterns. We've got a higher time frame as a filter. Our immediate objective is just looking for tests, because if we've backed off a little bit, you run up, you have a bull flag, you make a high, maybe the S&P pulls back three or four points. We're just simply looking for a test. If it's a good trade, it will run deeper, and you'll get the benefit of some extra slippage in your favor.

And then the last thing that's important that I find important with watching these S&Ps is almost every major turning point on the S&Ps, be it whether you're looking at a five-minute time frame or an hourly chart, has some form of non-confirmation. And that's what I watch during the day. I'll watch the NASDAQ futures. I'll watch the Dow.

The ticks and just about always there will be one index making a higher high and the other index will fail to confirm, or else you will have a high on the ticks and then the next high up in the S&P the ticks will make a lower high. But in particular, looking at the different groups, the sectors, the momentum stocks, the Dow, this principle of confirmation, non-confirmation, is not only powerful in looking at reversals and sometimes these things you know you don't see them as they're happening. A lot of times you do see them after the fact but they're powerful enough that you have confidence it's going to continue on in that other direction or that new direction.

And we actually had that in the, I believe in the S&Ps when they were making their lows two, three days ago. If you looked at a short term time frame like a 10 or 15 minute chart, the S&Ps were making new lows and the NASDAQ futures weren't. And it was real blatant. The NASDAQ futures have been momentum leaders pretty much for the last couple years. So it's not only important in looking at the reversals but it's going to give you added confidence once the thing does turn. For example, if the S&Ps start making new hourly highs and the Dow starts making new hourly highs or the NASDAQ futures, it should give you enough confidence that you practically feel like you could just pick up the phone and buy. You want to be a little bit more sensitive than that but it should make you feel good. Now you've got the right direction pegged.

Now you've got conceptually that we've been at the lower end of the trading range, all the indices have started making new hourly highs and now we're going to take out the upper end of the trading range. So you can use it in that sense. So these non-confirmation confirmation, looking at the short term continuation patterns and noting the impulse, letting the market tell you which direction it can go, simple concepts and they'll serve you well. And all you have to do is have a trigger to get into that trade. You want to put a buy stop slightly above the market, put in a low bid right around where it's testing, get in and then manage that trade. These simple concepts will always keep you in the odds, in the favor, favor in the right direction.

So the trade management, it will keep you mentally in the game, it will give you confidence, let it become automatic and it'll all tie in together.

*Long pause*

This isn't how I wanted to end my talk, right, like that, you know? *Laughter* But, yes?

> One thing, when I interviewed you a couple years ago, you made a point that at the beginning of the year, you approach trading a certain way so you have a specific method. I don't want to fool things, but I think you remember you said how you think it would work to take this more profitable trade.

Well, there's a couple things. This gets back to a very key factor, your ability to move on, forget about the last trade, always think forward, okay? So if you come into those markets every day, you should feel like today's a new day, today's a clean slate, all right? That's the beautiful thing about this business is that we wake up, we get a fresh chance every day to do better than the day we did before. Every month is a new month, every year is a new year. You see, so much of trading, the attitude of how you frame it out, okay, is how you look at it. Do you want to look at it like here's an opportunity to be better this week than you were last week, you know, better this year than the year before?

And what you're talking about is a principle at the beginning of the year, we can wipe the slate clean, say gosh, you know, here's a chance for me to really put in a good year's performance and you start off, again, the management taking one step at a time, one day at a time, one trade to slowly build it up, this gets down to the unit size and the leverage. Hey, if it gets it rolling, you know, back to what these guys say, they say, all of them, theory is different from practice. The theory is so important because you have to have a model to go by and the model is going to be an imperfect model.

I mean, I don't want to make any comments about engineers if there's any engineers in this room, but I've seen more people with engineering backgrounds that want to stuff the market into a little black box. I see Murray laughing down there at that one. They want to stuff the market into a little black box and it's tough. You have to accept all its imperfections and its limitations, you know. It will do freak radical things and, you know, every system that is successful that stands the test of time tends to capitalize on these aberrations in behavior, okay, the long trend following systems. This is one of the best performing systems out there, aberration based on large standard deviation moves, abnormal events telling you something unusual is going on out there, all right.

So you have to have a model or a structure or a framework to work within, right, but on the other hand, that's where the little smarts, the street smart sense comes down where Wyckoff would say, we'll look at the market's little attempts to shake you out, watch the market's attempts to fool everybody before it really resumes its plan. And so the practice part is going to differ from the theory because sometimes we have to do what is going to make the game palatable to us, all right, and it's okay to make a feel-good trade. It's okay to get in there and say, I'm going to see if I can take a penny out of corn, who cares if you miss the main trend, you know. I go in sometimes and I look for like little five-minute grail-buys or sales, you know, it's like the kick of taking it, you know, it's like, haha, I got one up on the market, you know, well, so I made 50 bucks, who cares, you know. We joke around, we call that a pizza party, you know.

So it's whatever keeps you happy in the game, in the groove, and for some people they might approach it more seriously in the sense that they have their business plan and they're going to follow the plan. And this comes down to where it's knowing yourself. What is going to work for you? I have to know by now that there's probably five trades I'm going to miss for every one trade that I actually take or execute, you know. I see the things all the time, but there's going to be a lot of times where it's like, I'm just burned out or I'm tired or I, you know, I have to get into the kitchen and make myself a cup of tea and I'm going to miss something. That's okay. You're onto the next trade. That's the great thing about the markets. There is opportunity every single day forward. You can never look at what you've missed.

So whatever makes it palatable to yourself, don't feel bad if you're starting out and you only feel comfortable staying in the market for five minutes and that's it. There's no big master game plan that says that you have to get in and see.

With a trade and trail a stop in a trend. If it's too uncomfortable for you, you know you're going to start stressing yourself and you don't trade well when you're under stress. What you will find is that every time you make a trade, every day you're watching your markets, you will grow, and your tolerance level will grow. Your psychological understanding of yourself and of the markets will grow, and you'll grow with your leverage and your trading size and your ability to stay in a trade. That will grow as you get older and more experienced.

I want to read one quote for you to tie it up. This is actually how I wanted to end my talk after all that. Okay. Forgot about it. This was the first book I ever read and I don't even know if it's in print anymore and of course it was my father's. You know, it's always like, you know, your family member that gets you into this wretched business sometime. I was like 10 years old. I didn't know what the heck I was doing. He gave me some charts and told me to look for a certain pattern and I was fine. I think he used to trade shell eggs by lunar cycles. He went bankrupt as a builder, so. The answer was not in trading shell eggs with lunar cycles, but this is a little book called The Treasury of Wall Street Wisdom and what it did is it boiled down each of these fabulous forefathers of technical analysis from Dow who did such a great job. It's probably about five little snippets from each of them and their golden rules.

And so I read this and of course, you know, you forget about it and then you actually start trading and you don't apply any of the principles you should. You still learn everything the hard way. But this is a little quote by Samuel Nelson who was one of the people that was a Dow disciple and he wrote, "Early success is misleading and deceptive. It's almost a tradition that novices who plunge successfully in the first year are very often failures in the second or third year."

A queer thing about this business or this trade is that you may acquire it very slowly and gradually or you may stick at it and work away for months and months when suddenly, in the most mysterious way, the whole thing opens up to you and what seemed very difficult becomes comparatively simple. You learn by the process of elimination.

And with that, I have to say, I have seen over and over that people struggle in this business for one year, for three years, for six years. And I know you can read it in all the Market Wizards books. It's like it took six years before you could even turn a profit. We all struggle and it's like one day, maybe out of the toils of our efforts or our labors, something becomes clear or dawns or all of a sudden it feels easy. And if you have the faith and the confidence that that will happen, it will happen. But I've seen very, very few traders be able to make a consistent living year after year in the first three years of trading. It is a bit of work. It's a journey. It's learning through that process of elimination. And that's going to happen a lot of times through your own mistakes, through this trial and error process, finding what works for you and what doesn't work for you.

So, I mean, for me, after all these years of trading, aha, a bull flag. Here's the answer. Here's the key. So, with that, you've got to look at your own self, your own journey. Have patience and trust that it will unfold for you. And in the meantime, it's the greatest hobby in the world and you have to enjoy the process. And you have to enjoy studying it and the opportunity to be at a conference like tonight where you've got all these wonderful resources at your disposal, not only in the software and the indicator and the books that are available to you, but each other and talking to each other.

Trading can be a lonely business by yourself. And it's amazing when you start talking to another trader and you say things, "Well, that happened to you? Oh, I didn't know that was the only person that did that a million times." People are always surprised at the mistakes that I make. "You mean you do that, too?" "Oh, yes, I do that, too. I've done that too many times to mention." But it's like misery loves company and it also puts you in a fraternity. And every time I talk to another trader, he spills his big loss about the dumb thing that he did and it's like, "Oh, I don't feel so stupid anymore."

So, take this opportunity, too, not only to hear the speakers and mingle among the exhibits, but to try to talk to each other, another trader, to share some common experiences and you'll see that we all are following the same journey in different roundabout little paths. And hopefully, we'll all end up at the same goal of finding our own program, something that works for us and feeling good about that.

So, enjoy the rest of the weekend. Thank you very much for tonight. Let me just say I have the little thing on the table. If anybody wants to come onto the Internet and join us next week for free and watch what I do and the types of things, these little bull flags I was talking about in the markets, I put them on there as they're setting up. You can see them setting up. I tell you where I'm getting filled. I tell you my lousy slippage and stuff. So, come join us next week if you would like. Thank you very much.
