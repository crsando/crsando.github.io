# 评述 Review

结合周三符合市场预期的7月CPI数据，周四美国零售环比公布为1%(好于市场预期)，上周首申隆至7月以来的最低水平，利率期货市场定价美联储今年降息幅度减少到93个基点，9月隆息50bp的概率回落至27%。

Taking into account the market's expectations for July CPI data released on Wednesday and the better-than-expected 1% monthly increase in US retail sales announced on Thursday, which marked the lowest level since July, the futures market is now pricing-in a reduced likelihood of a total 93 basis point cut in the Fed's interest rates this year, with the probability of a 50 basis point hike in September falling to 27%.

近期接连公布的经济数据有所企稳改善，进一步缓解市场对于美国经济大幅下滑的担忧，
与海外相关度较高商品均出现上涨表现，**铜价**再次回升至9100美金附近。

Recent economic data releases have shown signs of stabilization and improvement, further alleviating concerns about a significant downturn in the US economy. This has led to a rise in commodity prices with strong international correlations, pushing **Copper** prices back up to around 9100 US dollars.

即期基本面上，下游需求淡季不淡，9月中上旬前基本面对于铜价存在支撑

Fundamentally, downstream demand remains somewhat subdued as we approach the middle to late part of September, providing a supportive backdrop for copper prices.

1. 前期盘面持续下跌后，下游点价意愿提升
2. 部分下游反馈7、8月订单出现释放，近期现货升贴水持续回升，后续进一步观察交割之后下游补库情况。

1. Following a prolonged period of downward pressure, there has been an increase in downstream spot buying interest.
2. Some downstream feedback indicates that orders for July and August have been released, with recent spot premiums continuing to rise. Further observation is needed on downstream restocking post-deliveries.

整体去看，需求向上弹性依然较为有限(市场对于海外需求的担心需要经历至少连续的2、3个月度级别数据改善才会真正扭转，国内基建项目较往年偏少)，

Overall, the elasticity of demand remains limited in its upward trajectory (concerns about overseas demand need at least two to three consecutive months of data improvement to truly reverse, and domestic infrastructure projects are fewer compared to previous years). In the short term, prices are approaching the previously indicated first marginal levels of LME-9100 US dollars per metric ton / Shanghai Copper-73630, with the second marginal levels around LME-9500 US dollars / Shanghai Copper-76860.

短期已接近我们前期给出的第一边际LME-9100美金/沪铜-73630附近，第二边际在LME-9500美金/沪铜-76860左右。

In the short term, prices are approaching the previously indicated first marginal levels of LME-9100 US dollars per metric ton / Shanghai Copper-73630, with the second marginal levels around LME-9500 US dollars / Shanghai Copper-76860.

短期，9月上旬前建议参考估值谨慎持有多单(靠近9100美金-9250美金/沪铜74230附近适量减仓)。

In the short term, it is advised to exercise caution in holding long positions before early September (near 9100 US dollars to 9250 US dollars / Shanghai Copper 74230, with some moderate reduction in holdings).

往四季度明年一季度去看，趋势方向向下的概率更大一些，国内7月社融数据显示出国内有效投资依然不足，相对应终端需求弹性依然较弱，海外费半指数对全球制造业指引高位回落，中期策略上逢反弹高空。

Looking towards the fourth quarter and the first quarter of next year, the probability of a downward trend is higher. The July domestic social finance data indicates that effective domestic investment remains insufficient, and corresponding terminal demand elasticity is still weak. The overseas PMI index for manufacturing has fallen from its highs, suggesting a cautious approach to shorting on rebounds in the medium term.
